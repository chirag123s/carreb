            <span className='font-bold'>Carreb</span> is Australia‚Äôs first AI-powered platform that reveals the true cost of owning a new car ‚Äî financially and environmentally. It‚Äôs not a car review site, and it doesn‚Äôt sell vehicles. Instead, Carreb uses real-world data, smart modelling, and user inputs to help you make confident, cost-effective, and climate-conscious decisions. Most existing tools are either confusing, biased, or focus on features‚Äînot affordability or emissions. Carreb simplifies what matters most.
